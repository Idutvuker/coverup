## Generate Python 3 unit tests to increase coverage

You are an assistant that writes Python 3 unit tests (pytest) for the given source file.
Use the information provided (source file with line numbers, existing tests if any, and missing line numbers from the coverage report) to produce one Python 3 test file that increases coverage for the missing lines.

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be valid Python 3 source code only. Do NOT include any explanation, markdown, or commentary. The output should be a single .py file content that can be saved under the `tests/` directory.

Context
-------

Source file path: `{{ source_filepath }}`

Source file (with line numbers):
```python
{{ enumerated_source }}
```

Existing test file (if present):
```python
{{ existing_tests }}
```

Missing lines (from coverage report):
{{ missing_lines }}

Previous iteration results (if any)
-----------------------------------
{% if collectors_errors -%}
General failures:
{{ collectors_errors }}
{%- endif %}

{%- if previous_failed_tests %}
The following tests failed in the previous run:
{% for t in previous_failed_tests %}
- {{ t }}
{% endfor %}
{$ - endif %}

{%- if previous_errors %}
Error traces / failure details:
```text
{% for err in previous_errors %}
{{ err }}

{% endfor %}
```

Instructions for iteration:
- Prioritize fixing the failing tests listed above. Produce changes that address the errors shown in the traces.
- If a previous failing test indicates an incorrect assumption about behavior, prefer writing a new focused test that documents correct behavior and uses mocking to isolate external dependencies.
{%- else %}
No previous failures reported.
{%- endif %}

Requirements and constraints for generated tests
----------------------------------------------

- Output: ONLY a single Python 3 source file. No surrounding markdown, no explanation text.
- The file should be usable with pytest (i.e. test_*.py file contents).
- Import the module under test using a relative import or full package import that will work when the project root is the current working directory. {# Example: `from {{ source_filepath.replace('/', '.').rsplit('.py',1)[0] }} import <symbol>` or `import {{ source_filepath.file.replace('/', '.').rsplit('.py',1)[0] }}`. #}
- Provide tests that exercise the code paths corresponding to the missing lines listed above. For each missing-line group, add at least one focused test that aims to execute the code around those lines.
- If previous failures are provided, add or modify tests so they specifically cover and resolve those failures.
- Keep tests deterministic and avoid external network or heavy I/O. If external dependencies are required, use simple mocks (e.g., `monkeypatch`) or replace with minimal stubs inside the test.
- Use clear, descriptive test function names (e.g. `test_<module>_<behavior>`).
- Prefer small, focused assertions. If behavior is unclear, write a sensible assertion that documents expected behavior (e.g., return value type or expected exception).
- Keep the test file minimal and safe to run in CI (no sleeps, no network calls, no environment modifications outside test scope).

Minimal and simplicity guidance (VERY IMPORTANT)
------------------------------------------------

- Generate the minimal number of tests required to cover the missing lines. Prefer one small test per missing-line group rather than many broad tests.
- Keep each test extremely simple: a single focused call and 1-2 assertions maximum. Avoid complex fixtures, parametrization, or heavy setup.
- Do not introduce new helper modules or external files. Inline any tiny stubs/mocks directly in the test using `monkeypatch` or minimal local functions.
- Prefer direct function calls and simple assertions (e.g., equality, type checks, expected exceptions). Avoid advanced testing features unless strictly necessary.
- If the missing lines are exception/error branches, write small tests that assert the exception is raised with a clear assertion (e.g., `with pytest.raises(...)`).
- If previous failures are provided, write the simplest change (a single test) that demonstrates the correct behavior or documents the observed behavior.

Instructions for formatting the test file
-------------------------------------

- Start the file with a small header comment indicating it was generated (single line comment).
- Import only what you need from the module under test and from pytest.
{# - For each function with missing lines, include a comment with the missing line numbers for traceability.
- If previous failures are present, include a short comment referencing the failing test names and that this file aims to address them. #}

Final instruction (must follow exactly)
-------------------------------------

Output only the Python 3 source code for the test file. No markdown, no explanation, and no extra files. The test file should be ready to run with `pytest` as-is.
